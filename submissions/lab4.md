# Lab 4

## Task 1

### Decode the capture

The packet capture in `lab4-trace.txt` shows a complete localhost request to QuickNotes over IPv6 loopback (`::1`) on port `8080`. The relevant request starts at `10:07:22.001973`.

#### TCP three-way handshake

```text
10:07:22.001973 IP6 ::1.41078 > ::1.8080: Flags [S], seq 1569259689, ... length 0
10:07:22.002000 IP6 ::1.8080 > ::1.41078: Flags [S.], seq 3570494351, ack 1569259690, ... length 0
10:07:22.002013 IP6 ::1.41078 > ::1.8080: Flags [.], ack 1, ... length 0
```

Annotation:

- The first packet is the client SYN from ephemeral port `41078` to QuickNotes on port `8080`.
- The second packet is the server SYN/ACK from port `8080` back to the client.
- The third packet is the client ACK, completing the TCP three-way handshake.

#### HTTP request

```text
10:07:22.002070 IP6 ::1.41078 > ::1.8080: Flags [P.], seq 1:175, ack 1, ... length 174: HTTP: POST /notes HTTP/1.1
POST /notes HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
User-Agent: curl/8.5.0
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 39

{"title":"trace me","body":"in flight"}
```

Annotation:

- The HTTP request line is `POST /notes HTTP/1.1`.
- The request is sent to `localhost:8080`.
- The body is JSON with title `trace me` and body `in flight`.

#### HTTP response

```text
10:07:22.003042 IP6 ::1.8080 > ::1.41078: Flags [P.], seq 1:207, ack 175, ... length 206: HTTP: HTTP/1.1 201 Created
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Tue, 16 Jun 2026 07:07:22 GMT
Content-Length: 93

{"id":7,"title":"trace me","body":"in flight","created_at":"2026-06-16T07:07:22.002480556Z"}
```

Annotation:

- QuickNotes returned `HTTP/1.1 201 Created`, which means the note was created successfully.
- The response body includes the created note with `id`, `title`, `body`, and `created_at`.

#### Connection close

```text
10:07:22.003282 IP6 ::1.41078 > ::1.8080: Flags [F.], seq 175, ack 207, ... length 0
10:07:22.003353 IP6 ::1.8080 > ::1.41078: Flags [F.], seq 207, ack 176, ... length 0
10:07:22.003378 IP6 ::1.41078 > ::1.8080: Flags [.], ack 208, ... length 0
```

Annotation:

- The client starts the connection shutdown with `FIN`.
- The server replies with its own `FIN`.
- The final client ACK completes the TCP connection close.

### Five debugging commands

#### 1. What's listening?

Command:

```bash
ss -tlnp | grep :8080
```

Output:

```text
LISTEN 0      4096               *:8080             *:*    users:(("quicknotes",pid=2898953,fd=3))
```

Decision:

QuickNotes is running and listening on TCP port `8080`. The process name is `quicknotes`, with PID `2898953`.

#### 2. Routes from the host

Command:

```bash
ip route show
```

Output:

```text
default via 10.90.120.1 dev eno1 proto dhcp src 10.90.120.190 metric 100
default via 10.91.48.1 dev wlp179s0 proto dhcp src 10.91.48.93 metric 600
10.90.120.0/22 dev eno1 proto kernel scope link src 10.90.120.190 metric 100
10.91.48.0/20 dev wlp179s0 proto kernel scope link src 10.91.48.93 metric 600
172.17.0.0/16 dev docker0 proto kernel scope link src 172.17.0.1 linkdown
172.18.0.0/16 dev br-24184173a529 proto kernel scope link src 172.18.0.1 linkdown
172.19.0.0/16 dev br-92a7596f9709 proto kernel scope link src 172.19.0.1 linkdown
172.20.0.0/16 dev br-1fb3ccd5b653 proto kernel scope link src 172.20.0.1 linkdown
192.168.122.0/24 dev virbr0 proto kernel scope link src 192.168.122.1 linkdown
```

Decision:

The host has active default routes through `eno1` and `wlp179s0`. Docker and virtualization bridge networks are present but currently marked `linkdown`, so they are not relevant to the local QuickNotes request on `localhost`.

#### 3. Local reachability

Command:

```bash
mtr -rwc 5 localhost
```

Output:

```text
Start: 2026-06-16T10:17:52+0300
HOST: pc        Loss%   Snt   Last   Avg  Best  Wrst StDev
  1.|-- localhost  0.0%     5    0.1   0.1   0.1   0.1   0.0
```

Decision:

`localhost` is reachable with `0.0%` packet loss and about `0.1 ms` latency. The loopback path is healthy.

#### 4. DNS check

Command:

```bash
dig +short example.com @1.1.1.1
```

Output:

```text
8.6.112.0
8.47.69.0
```

Decision:

DNS resolution through Cloudflare DNS (`1.1.1.1`) works because the query returned IP addresses for `example.com`.

#### 5. User service logs

Command:

```bash
journalctl --user -u quicknotes -n 20 || true
```

Output:

```text
-- No entries --
```

Decision:

There are no `systemd --user` journal entries for `quicknotes`. This is expected because QuickNotes was run manually for this task, not as a user-level systemd service.

### 502 debugging reflection

If QuickNotes returned `502 Bad Gateway`, I would first check the component in front of QuickNotes, such as a reverse proxy, load balancer, or gateway, because a 502 usually means the gateway could not get a valid response from the upstream service. I would verify that QuickNotes is actually running, confirm it is listening on the expected address and port with `ss -tlnp`, and test the upstream directly with `curl http://localhost:8080/health`. If the app is not reachable, I would inspect process logs for crashes, bind failures, or configuration errors. If the app is reachable locally, I would then check the proxy upstream address, routing, firewall rules, and DNS configuration.

## Task 2

### Broken deploy reproduction

Commands:

```bash
cd app/
ADDR=:8080 go run . &
PID1=$!
sleep 1
ADDR=:8080 go run . 2>&1 | tee /tmp/qn-broken.log &
PID2=$!
sleep 2
cat /tmp/qn-broken.log
ps -ef | grep quicknotes | grep -v grep
ps -ef | grep "go run" | grep -v grep
```

Output:

```text

```

Decision:

The broken deploy was reproduced successfully. The first QuickNotes instance started on port `8080`. The second instance attempted to bind to the same port and failed with `listen tcp :8080: bind: address already in use`.

### Outside-in debugging chain

#### 1. Is the process running?

Commands:

```bash
ps -ef | grep quicknotes | grep -v grep
ps -ef | grep "go run" | grep -v grep
```

Output:

```text
mostafa  2913671 2913573  0 10:26 pts/3    00:00:00 /home/mostafa/.cache/go-build/32/32655a38a659cde499c37fabd7e81ec7a161a2e7297b91b6bb17f272b23aa937-d/quicknotes
mostafa  2913573 2899005  2 10:26 pts/3    00:00:02 /snap/go/11200/bin/go run .
```

Decision:

One QuickNotes process is still running. The failed second startup exited, but the first `go run .` wrapper and its compiled `quicknotes` child process remain active.

#### 2. Is it listening?

Command:

```bash
ss -tlnp | grep 8080
```

Output:

```text
LISTEN 0      4096               *:8080             *:*    users:(("quicknotes",pid=2913671,fd=3))
```

Decision:

Port `8080` is already owned by the running `quicknotes` process. This confirms that the second process failed because the address was already in use.

#### 3. Is it reachable from the host?

Commands:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8080/health
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health
```

Output:

```text
200
{"notes":8,"status":"ok"}
```

Decision:

The active QuickNotes instance is reachable from the host and returns a healthy response. The issue is not local reachability to the already-running service.

#### 4. Is a firewall blocking it?

Command:

```bash
sudo iptables -L -n -v 2>/dev/null || sudo nft list ruleset 2>/dev/null || true
```

Output excerpt:

```text
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT 39M packets, 61G bytes)

```

Decision:

The firewall output shows default `ACCEPT` policies for `INPUT` and `OUTPUT`, and the localhost health check already succeeded. A firewall block is not the cause of this failure.

#### 5. Does DNS resolve localhost?

Command:

```bash
dig +short localhost
```

Output:

```text
127.0.0.1
```

Decision:

`localhost` resolves to `127.0.0.1`, so local name resolution is working. DNS is not the cause of the failed startup.

### Repair and re-verify

Commands:

```bash
ss -tlnp | grep 8080
kill 2913671
sleep 1
ss -tlnp | grep 8080 || echo "nothing listening on 8080"
ADDR=:8080 go run . &
PID1=$!
sleep 1
ss -tlnp | grep 8080
curl -s http://localhost:8080/health
```

Output:

```text
LISTEN 0      4096               *:8080             *:*    users:(("quicknotes",pid=2913671,fd=3))
2026/06/16 10:33:18 shutting down
nothing listening on 8080

[3] 2918953
2026/06/16 10:33:31 quicknotes listening on :8080 (notes loaded: 8)

LISTEN 0      4096               *:8080             *:*    users:(("quicknotes",pid=2919053,fd=3))
{"notes":8,"status":"ok"}
```

Decision:

The conflicting listener was stopped, port `8080` was confirmed free, QuickNotes restarted cleanly, and `/health` returned a valid response.

### Root cause

The second QuickNotes instance failed because another QuickNotes process was already listening on TCP port `8080`. The exact root-cause error was:

```text
listen: listen tcp :8080: bind: address already in use
```

### Mini-postmortem

The broken deploy was caused by two QuickNotes instances trying to bind to the same TCP port, `:8080`. This is a systemic deployment risk because process startup can fail when port ownership is not coordinated, old processes are left running, or service managers do not enforce a single active instance. The application code was not the root problem; the runtime environment already had the required port occupied.

This kind of failure can be prevented with service supervision and deployment checks. A `systemd` unit can manage one authoritative process, stop old instances cleanly, restart failed services, and expose logs through `journalctl`. Pre-flight checks such as `ss -tlnp | grep 8080` can detect port conflicts before rollout. Health checks can confirm that the intended instance is serving traffic after restart.

## Bonus Task

### HTTPS layer

QuickNotes only serves HTTP directly on port `8080`, so I added Caddy as a TLS-terminating reverse proxy on port `8443`.

Commands:

```bash
echo 'localhost:8443 {
  reverse_proxy localhost:8080
}' | sudo tee /etc/caddy/Caddyfile

sudo systemctl restart caddy
sudo systemctl status caddy --no-pager
```

Output excerpt:

```text
caddy.service - Caddy
Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/caddy.service; enabled; preset: enabled)
Active: active (running) since Tue 2026-06-16 10:50:33 MSK
Main PID: 2930518 (caddy)
```

Decision:

Caddy started successfully and listened as the HTTPS reverse proxy for `localhost:8443`.

### HTTPS health check

Command:

```bash
curl -vk https://localhost:8443/health
```

Output excerpt:

```text
* TLSv1.3 (OUT), TLS handshake, Client hello (1):
* TLSv1.3 (IN), TLS handshake, Server hello (2):
* SSL connection using TLSv1.3 / TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 / X25519 / id-ecPublicKey
* ALPN: server accepted h2
< HTTP/2 200
< server: Caddy
{"notes":8,"status":"ok"}
```

Decision:

The HTTPS request completed successfully. Caddy terminated TLS, negotiated `TLSv1.3` with cipher suite `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`, and proxied the request to QuickNotes.

### TLS packet capture

Commands:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -i lo -nn -s 0 -w lab4-tls.pcap 'tcp port 8443' &
TCPDUMP_PID=$!

curl -vk https://localhost:8443/health

sudo kill $TCPDUMP_PID
wait $TCPDUMP_PID 2>/dev/null
```

The resulting capture file is `lab4-tls.pcap`.

### ClientHello

Screenshot:

![ClientHello packet in Wireshark](../images/lab4/client_hello.png)

Annotation:

- The ClientHello is visible in Wireshark as `Client Hello (SNI=localhost)`.
- The client connects to Caddy on `localhost:8443`.
- The Server Name Indication extension identifies the requested hostname as `localhost`.
- The ClientHello advertises supported TLS versions and cipher suites, allowing the server to choose a mutually supported TLS version and cipher.

### ServerHello

Screenshot:

![ServerHello packet in Wireshark](../images/lab4/server_hello.png)

Annotation:

- The ServerHello is visible in Wireshark after the matching ClientHello.
- The negotiated protocol is `TLSv1.3`.
- The selected cipher suite is `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`.
- The selected temporary key exchange group is `X25519`, matching the `curl -vk` and `openssl s_client` output.

### Certificate chain

Command:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect localhost:8443 -servername localhost -showcerts </dev/null 2>&1 | tee lab4-tls-cert-chain.txt
```

Output excerpt:

```text
Certificate chain

Verification error: unable to get local issuer certificate
---
New, TLSv1.3, Cipher is TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
Verify return code: 20 (unable to get local issuer certificate)
```

Decision:

The certificate chain is Caddy's local development certificate chain. The verification warning is expected because the local Caddy root certificate is not trusted by the host certificate store. The TLS handshake still completed successfully.

### TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 deprecation

TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are rejected during the protocol-version negotiation part of the handshake. The client advertises supported versions in the ClientHello, and the server selects an acceptable version in the ServerHello. In this capture, the server selected `TLSv1.3`; a client that only supported TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1 would fail during negotiation before any HTTP request reached QuickNotes.
